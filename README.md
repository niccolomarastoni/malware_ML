# Learning Malicious Behaviors from Dynamically Extracted Program Traces

This is just a notebook I wrote for the final project of the course in [Artificial Intelligence](http://www.di.univr.it/dol//?ent=oi&cs=417&id=99887) at the University of Verona, it's not intended to be representative of the state of the art, nor will it offer any expert insight into either machine learning nor malware, as I am currently studying both.    
It's mostly an explorative notebook, a free flowing process of delving into a dataset and trying to make sense of it, while learning how to use the tools properly.    
You can comment and report any mistakes both in the code or in the general process here or via mail at [niccolo.marastoni@gmail.com](mailto:niccolo.marastoni@gmail.com).
